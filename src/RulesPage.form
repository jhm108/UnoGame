            <Property name="text" type="java.lang.String" value="Setup: The game is for 2-10 players, ages 7 and over. Every player starts with seven cards, &#xa;and they are dealt face down. The rest of the cards are placed in a Draw Pile face down.&#xa; Next to the pile a space should be designated for a Discard Pile. &#xa;The top card should be placed in the Discard Pile, and the game begins!&#xa;&#xa;Game Play: The first player is normally the player to the left of the dealer&#xa; (you can also choose the youngest player) and gameplay usually follows a clockwise direction.&#xa; Every player views his/her cards and tries to match the card in the Discard Pile.&#xa;&#xa;You have to match either by the number, color, or the symbol/Action. &#xa;For instance, if the Discard Pile has a red card that is an 8 you have to&#xa; place either a red card or a card with an 8 on it. You can also play a Wild card &#xa;(which can alter current color in play).&#xa;&#xa;If the player has no matches or they choose not to play any of their cards even though&#xa; they might have a match, they must draw a card from the Draw pile. If that card can be played, play it.&#xa; Otherwise, the game moves on to the next person in turn. You can also play a Wild card, or a Wild Draw Four card on your turn.&#xa;&#xa;Note: If the first card turned up from the Draw Pile (to form the Discard Pile) is an Action card, &#xa;the Action from that card applies and must be carried out. The exceptions are if the Wild or&#xa; Wild Draw Four cards are turned up, in which case &#x2013; Return them to the Draw Pile, shuffle them,&#xa; and turn over a new card. At any time, if the Draw Pile becomes depleted and no one has yet won the round,&#xa; take the Discard Pile, shuffle it, and turn it over to regenerate a new Draw Pile.&#xa;&#xa;There are two different ways to play regarding drawing new cards. The Official Uno Rules states that after a card&#xa; is drawn the player can discard it if it is a match, or if not, play passes on to the next player. &#xa;The other type is where players continue to draw cards until they have a match, even if it is 10 times.&#xa;&#xa;The game continues until a player has one card left. The moment a player has just one card they must yell &#x201c;UNO!&#x201d;.&#xa; If they are caught not saying &#x201c;Uno&#x201d; by another player before any card has been played, the player must draw two new cards.&#xa; Once a player has no cards remaining, the game round is over, points are scored, and the game begins over again.&#xa; Normally, everyone tries to be the first one to achieve 500 points, but you can also choose whatever&#xa; points number to win the game, as long as everyone agrees to it.&#xa;&#xa;Action Cards: Besides the number cards, there are several other cards that help mix up the game. These are called Action or Symbol cards.&#xa;&#xa;uno action cards&#xa;&#xa;Reverse &#x2013; If going clockwise, switch to counterclockwise or vice versa.&#xa;Skip &#x2013; When a player places this card, the next player has to skip their turn. If turned up at the beginning, &#xa;the first player loses his/her turn.&#xa;Draw Two &#x2013; When a person places this card, the next player will have to pick up two cards and forfeit his/her turn.&#xa;Wild &#x2013; This card represents all four colors, and can be placed on any card. The player has to state which color it will represent for the next player.&#xa; It can be played regardless of whether another card is available.&#xa;Wild Draw Four &#x2013; This acts just like the wild card except that the next player also has to draw four cards. With this card, &#xa;you must have no other alternative cards to play that matches the color of the card previously played. If you play this card illegally&#xa;, you may be challenged by the other player to show your hand. If guilty, you need to draw 4 cards. If not, the challenger needs to draw 6 cards instead.&#xa;Scoring: When a player no longer has any cards and the game ends, he receives points. All opponents&#x2019; cards are given to the winner and points are counted.&#xa; All number cards are the same value as the number on the card (e.g. a 9 is 9 points).&#xa; &#x201c;Draw Two&#x201d; &#x2013; 20 Points, &#x201c;Reverse&#x201d; &#x2013; 20 Points, &#x201c;Skip&#x201d; &#x2013; 20 Points, &#x201c;Wild&#x201d; &#x2013; 50 Points, and &#x201c;Wild Draw Four&#x201d; &#x2013; 50 Points. &#xa;The first player to attain 500 points wins the game.&#xa;&#xa;Alternative Gameplay:&#xa;&#xa;This is the alternative Uno gameplay proposed by Mattel. This is done by keeping a running tally of&#xa; the total points left in each player&#x2019;s hand at the end of each round. Players reaching 500 points (or any designated amount) are slowly eliminated until only two are left.&#xa; The final two players then challenge each other (under Two Player rules) until someone reaches 500 points and loses.&#xa;&#xa;Two Player &amp; Four Player Rules&#xa;&#xa;For two players, there is a slight change of rules:&#xa;&#xa;Reverse works like Skip&#xa;Play Skip, and you may immediately play another card&#xa;If you play a Draw Two or Wild Draw Four card, your opponent has to draw the number of cards required, &#xa;and then play immediately resumes back on your turn.&#xa;For four players (two-partner teams), players sit opposite their partners, and play until one of either partner goes out with one Uno card left.&#xa; Scoring for the winning team is done by adding up &#xa;all the points from opposing partner&#x2019;s hands.&#xa;&#xa;for more info: &#xa;http://www.unorules.com/"/>
